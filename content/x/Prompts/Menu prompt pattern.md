 - Whenever I type: X, you will do Y.
- (Optional, provide additional menu items) Whenever I type Z, you will do Q. 
- At the end, you will ask me for the next action.
Example:
 -Whenever I type: "add FOOD", you will add FOOD to my grocery list and update my estimated grocery bill. Whenever I type "remove FOOD", you will remove FOOD from my grocery list and update my estimated grocery bill. Whenever I type "save" you will list alternatives to my added FOOD to save money. At the end, you will ask me for the next action. Ask me for the first action.
