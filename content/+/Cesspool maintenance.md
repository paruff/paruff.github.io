Thank you for providing that detailed information. Based on what you've shared, here are some recommendations to maintain a healthy cesspool and potentially reduce pumping frequency:

1. Water Conservation:
   Your decision to divert grey water from the shower and washing machine to the orchard is excellent. This significantly reduces the load on your cesspool. Continue to practice water conservation methods like:
   - Using low-flow fixtures
   - Fixing leaks promptly
   - Spreading out laundry loads throughout the week

2. Waste Reduction:
   Being mostly vegetarian is beneficial as it typically means less fatty waste. Continue to avoid putting harmful substances down the drain, such as:
   - Cooking oils and grease
   - Non-biodegradable items
   - Harsh chemicals or cleaners

3. Bacterial Balance:
   The yeast and bacterial additives you're using monthly can be helpful, but be cautious not to overuse them. Natural bacteria in the system are usually sufficient. Consider reducing the frequency to every other month and monitor any changes.

4. Regular Inspections:
   Even though you're not experiencing issues, schedule annual professional inspections to catch potential problems early.

5. Landscaping:
   Ensure the area above and around the cesspool is clear of deep-rooted plants or trees that could interfere with the system.

6. Proper Usage:
   Continue to avoid using a garbage disposal, as this can significantly increase solid waste in the system.

7. Pumping Schedule:
   With only two people and the greywater diversion, you might be able to extend the time between pumpings. Monitor the sludge and scum levels annually. Generally, pumping is recommended when the sludge layer reaches 1/3 of the tank's depth.

8. Soil Management:
   Your sandy soil with some clay is generally good for a cesspool. To maintain soil percolation:
   - Avoid compacting the soil above the cesspool (no driving or heavy equipment)
   - Consider periodic aeration of the soil above the cesspool

9. Water Softeners:
   If you use a water softener, ensure the backwash isn't directed into the cesspool as it can disrupt the bacterial balance.

10. Documentation:
    Keep a log of pumping dates, inspections, and any maintenance performed. This can help you track patterns and optimize your maintenance schedule.

11. Education:
    Ensure all household members understand what should and shouldn't go into the cesspool.

Given that you've already had to pump twice this year, the greywater diversion should significantly reduce the load on your system. Monitor the situation over the next year; you may find that you can extend the time between pumpings considerably.

If you notice any changes in drain performance, odors, or wet spots in the yard, address them promptly to avoid more serious issues. Also, consider consulting with local cesspool professionals about regulations or guidelines specific to your area, as they may have additional insights based on local conditions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
