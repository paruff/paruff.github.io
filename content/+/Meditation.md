I have meditated on and off for years, since about high school. 

Recently I discovered [[The Mind Illuminate]]  a book and comprehensive system outlining steps of stages to mindfulness or enlightenment.

There after the passing fo the author there appears to be much less support for training in TMI so I am exploring unified Mindfulness from Shezin Young.

A goal of mine is to use the stages and steps aka guidance from TMI within the UM framework as well as a Integral model of cross training to include strength, cognitive development and balance individual practice with short and long retreats.

I intend to use [[03 Resources/Learning/deliberate practice]] to focus and develop my mindfulness and meditation skills. 

[[Unifed Mindfulness]]

Metta 
-   I wish you will find peace. May you live in peace.
-   I wish you would suffer less.
-   I wish you could know what itâ€™s like to be loved.
-   May you be safe and protected.
-   May you experience happiness.
-   May you develop forgiveness.
-   May you be saved.
-   May you give and feel love.
-   May you stay healthy and strong.
-   May you forgive yourself.
-   May you accept yourself.
