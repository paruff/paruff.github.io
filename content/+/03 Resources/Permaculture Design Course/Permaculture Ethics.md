 A people without an agreed-upon common basis to their actions is neither a community nor a nation. A people with a common ethic is a nation wherever they live.
 Thus, the place of habitation is secondary to a shared belief in the establishment of a harmonious world community.
 Just as we can select a global range of plants for a garden, we can select from all extant ethics and beliefs those elements that we see to be sustainable, useful, and beneficial to life and to our community. - [[Bill Mollison]]

Self ->Family -> Society -> All living things

  Universally agreed-upon ethics and core values

### Earth Care
### People Care
### Future Care

### Earth Care
we have a vested interest in nuturing and supporting functional ecosystems for the sake of our own health and existance.

Learn to live within our ecological means

Repair damaged ecosystems and regenerate degraded landscapes

Take our place as part of the living dynamic of this plant and become responsible and mindful citizens of the Earth's global ecosystem.

### People Care

* Our desings must meet the needs of people 
* We can meet those needs within the framework of the ethic of Earth care
* Promote self-reliance and community responsibility
* Extend the care of people to include future generations

How can we meet our fundamental needs for ...?
* food/food security
* Shelter
* Clean water
* Community connection and belonging
* Physical well-being
* Emotional well-bing
* Spirtitual well-being

A key aspect of the People Care ethic is transitioning from the concept of enduring change (powerlessness) to designing the change (empowerment)

#### Focus on problems
Feelings of powerlessness, eco-shame, depression, worthlessness, paralysis, hopelessness, despair, disconnection, etc.

#### Focus on solution
Feelings of empowerment, belonging, worthiness, hopefulness, connectedness, etc.


### Healing the great Disconnect
* no individual element of any ecosystem exists in isolation, but rather is always in relationship to and with the whole
* Nothing and no one exists in a vacuum
* The idea of seperation is an illusion
* Nothing thrives without community
* Interdependency is our lifeline
* Re-culturing toward a better society requires that we learn the language of interdependency
* It is much easier  to make poor decisions around how to meet our needs as humans when we disregard our connections to and within the community and natural ecosystems

We need to radically restore our relationship to this earth.

We've forgetten to honor and respect embedded in being part of the whole, of interacting with love and sincerity with the living community. We feeli embarrassed about reaching for connection and communication with the beings of this world, when it should be as natural to do so as it is to breathe.

We need to overcome our synicism, sarcasm and shame so we can take our mindful place and live in a balanced and intentional way on this planet.

* We have the privilege of sharing the harvests and the hardships together as one people

This requires mindful awareness the acknowledgement of the need for change , and the importance of focusing our efforts on personal, family and community shifts(hyper-local, local and regional)

### Future Care and fair share 

 * Acknowledge that current consumption patterns are based on the concept of never-ending supply and growth and unlimited availability of natural resources
 * Gain mindful awareness of what we are currently consuming and how much we actually need
 * Understan and modify (setlimits to ) our expectations of growth and consumption
 *
