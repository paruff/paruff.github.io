**NOTE: All these references and readings are optional.**

- Chapters 1 and 2 of [_**Uncommon Sense Teaching**_](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/uncommon-sense-teaching/) are especially helpful in providing helpful information related to this material.
    

**Video 1: The Essence of How We Learn**

**Neurons**

- To get a better sense of more anatomically correct neurons, see [**the beautiful images**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal) drawn by the pioneering father of modern neuroscience, Santiago Ramon y Cajal, .
    
- A quick overview video of the neuron can be found at [**2-Minute Neuroscience**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qS83wD29PY&vl=en). (As one viewer comments: “One hour in a textbook, still confused. 2 minutes on YouTube and I get it. What a world we live in lol.”) The main 2-Minute Neuroscience website, with many more videos about how the brain works, is [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/user/neurochallenged).
    

**Hebbian learning**

- Sejnowski, TJ. "[**The book of Hebb**](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(00)81025-9.pdf)." _Neuron_ 24, no. 4 (1999): 773-776.
    

**Growth Mindset**

Our statement to the effect that "it's not enough to have a growth mindset," is worthy of being unpacked. Carol Dweck, the originator of the theory surrounding a growth mindset, deserves credit for putting forth a [“**gold-standard” study**](https://theeconomyofmeaning.com/2018/03/04/a-preregistered-test-of-growth-mindset-produces-a-03-improvement-in-gpa-and-sets-a-gold-standard/) of growth mindset. She and her colleagues pre-registered their plans beforehand so intentions couldn’t be altered once the data came in, and the study was massive, involving over 12,000 students in 65 public schools.  Their findings showed a .03 improvement in GPA, which Dweck argues [**here**](http://mindsetscholarsnetwork.org/carol-dweck-responds-recent-criticisms-growth-mindset-research/) is significant. The effect size, however, is only a 0.08 overall (a good explanation of effect sizes is in chapter 3 of [_**e-Learning and the Science of Instruction**_](http://barbaraoakley.com/book-recommendations/#2481), by Ruth Colvin Clark and Richard E. Mayer). [**A meta-analysis**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617739704) by a different author group found the effect of growth mindset interventions to be too small to be practically meaningful. Meta-analysis co-author Brooke McNamara responds to Dweck’s criticism of the meta-analysis [**here**](http://theconversation.com/schools-are-buying-growth-mindset-interventions-despite-scant-evidence-that-they-work-well-96001). (We also have to give credit to McNamara, an assistant professor, and her chutzpah in being willing to look critically at the work of a world-renowned Stanford researcher.) This [**related discussion**](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/growth-mindset-education-psychological-theory-children-mirage) in _Wired_ also helps put growth mindset interventions into context. 

Scott Alexander Siskind, (writing as Scott Alexander), goes deep into an analysis of unusual anomalies in Carol Dweck’s published research on growth mindset in: “[**No Clarity around Growth Mindset**](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/08/no-clarity-around-growth-mindset-yet/),” _Slate Star Codex_, April 8, 2015. See also “[**Does mindset affect children’s ability, school achievement, or response to challenge? Three failures to replicate**](https://mrbartonmaths.com/resourcesnew/8.%20Research/Mindset/Mindset%20replication.pdf),” by Yue Li & Timothy C. Bates, with the following conclusions: “Praise for intelligence failed to harm post- challenge cognitive performance. Children’s mindsets had no relationship to their IQ or to their school grades. Finally believing ability to be malleable had no association with improvement of grades across the year. We conclude that the belief that basic ability is fixed is harmless, and that implicit theories of intelligence play no significant role in development of cognitive ability, response to challenge, or educational attainment.”

As leading mathematical modeler Emanuel Derman notes: “Theories describe and deal with the world on its own terms and must stand on their own two feet. Models stand on someone else’s feet. They are metaphors that compare the object of their attention to something else that it resembles. Resemblance is always partial, and so models necessarily simplify things and reduce the dimensions of the world. . . . In a nutshell, theories tell you what something is; models tell you merely what something is like” (p. 6). **Neural Reuse Theory**

This report observes: "We analyzed the PISA results to understand the relative impact of each of these practices. In all five regions, scores were generally higher when teachers took the lead. The more inquiry-based teaching was used, however, the lower the average PISA scores were. At first glance that looks like a damning verdict on inquiry-based teaching. When we dig deeper into the data, however, a more interesting story is revealed: the best results are achieved when the two styles work together. The “sweet spot” is to use teacher-directed instruction in most or almost all lessons, and inquiry-based teaching in some lessons. This pattern holds true across all five regions." The report goes on to say "School systems need to tread carefully in selecting inquiry-based teaching practices, however. Our analysis shows that there is a set of practices that have a negative impact on average student scores across almost all regions—even when applied in only some lessons. These practices include having students design their own experiments, asking them to do investigations to test ideas, having a class debate about investigations, and requiring students to argue about science questions."

The report observes: "One way to redress the balance between instructional techniques that are effective and those that are less so would be to follow an 80/20 rule whereby at least 80 percent of instructional time is devoted to direct instructional techniques and 20 percent of instructional time (at most) favours discovery-based techniques. Although some individual teachers already might follow a roughly 80/20 rule, provincial curricula, teachers’ professional development sessions and provincially approved (or mandated) textbooks tend to favour discovery-based techniques. Thus, pedagogical directives that stress ineffective discovery techniques should be removed from the curricula, and texts that incorporate effective direct instructional techniques should be included in provincially recommended textbook lists."

The authors note: “We have suggested that structured, explicit, teacher-directed instruction should be most effective when acquiring secondary skills that are remote from supporting primary systems and that take place in a species atypical, classroom context where the goal is oriented toward acquiring knowledge for its own sake [italics in original].” Interestingly, 2012 PISA achievement versus teaching style reveals a pattern supportive of Geary and Berch’s findings. The better the PISA scores, the more likely the country is to use direct instruction. See Mourshed, M, et al.
