I am taking the food forest course from Oregon State University 
https://workspace.oregonstate.edu/certificate/permaculture-food-forests

The homework included Plant profiles, and there is an [[01 Projects/Edible Forest/food forest/Plant profile sample]]  provided. I create a [[Templates/Plant Profile Template]] to do my homework.
