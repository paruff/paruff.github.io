This is a backup because the formatting of [[Book Template]] seems to get wonky. When that happens, you can copy and paste the below:

```
---
in:
  - "[[Books]]"
  - "[[Sources]]"
related: 
by:
  - "[[{{author}}]]"
publisher: "[[{{publisher}}]]"
published: {{publishDate}}
created: "{{DATE:YYYY-MM-DD}}"
bookType: 
bookCategory: {{category}}
bookGroup: 
pages: {{totalPage}}
image: {{coverUrl}}
year: 
yearXP: 
yearXPL: 
bookStatus: 
rating:
---

![image|150]({{coverUrl}})
```
