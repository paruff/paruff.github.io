Here's a list of evidence-based tools and techniques, followed by a structured plan:

Tools and Techniques:

1. Guided Reading: Use tools like QuickReader to gradually increase your reading pace.

2. Finger Tracking: Use your finger or a pointer to guide your eyes while reading.

3. Chunking: Practice reading groups of words rather than individual words.

4. Peripheral Vision Expansion: Exercises to widen your visual field.

5. Subvocalization Reduction: Techniques to minimize inner speech while reading.

6. Timed Reading Exercises: Regular practice with a timer to gauge and improve speed.

7. Skimming and Scanning: Techniques for quickly identifying key information.

8. Comprehension Checks: Ensure understanding is maintained as speed increases.

9. Text-to-Speech Software: To support reading complex texts, especially helpful for dyslexia.

10. Mind Mapping: Visual note-taking to enhance comprehension and retention.

Plan to Increase Reading Speed:

Week 1-2: Baseline and Fundamentals
- Day 1: Establish a baseline reading speed and comprehension level using QuickReader.
- Days 2-7: Practice finger tracking for 15 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of guided reading with QuickReader at 110-120 words per minute (wpm).
- Days 8-14: Introduce chunking exercises for 15 minutes, then 15 minutes of guided reading at 120-130 wpm.

Week 3-4: Building Speed and Expanding Vision
- Days 15-21: Start with 10 minutes of peripheral vision exercises, then 20 minutes of guided reading at 130-150 wpm.
- Days 22-28: Introduce subvocalization reduction techniques for 10 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of guided reading at 150-170 wpm.

Week 5-6: Advancing Techniques
- Days 29-35: Begin with 10 minutes of skimming and scanning practice, then 20 minutes of timed reading exercises aiming for 170-200 wpm.
- Days 36-42: Introduce mind mapping for 10 minutes after each reading session to enhance comprehension.

Week 7-8: Pushing Boundaries
- Days 43-49: Alternate between 25-minute sessions of guided reading (aiming for 200-250 wpm) and free reading of science fiction with finger tracking.
- Days 50-56: Introduce more challenging texts from "Gateway to the Great Books," using a combination of techniques for 30 minutes daily.

Week 9-10: Consolidation and Expansion
- Days 57-63: Practice all techniques in rotation, with guided reading sessions pushing to 250-300 wpm.
- Days 64-70: Begin longer reading sessions (45 minutes) with "Great Books of the Western World," incorporating all learned techniques.

Week 11-12: Final Push and Assessment
- Days 71-77: Focus on free reading at your new comfortable speed, aiming for 300-350 wpm.
- Days 78-84: Conduct daily 30-minute reading sprints, pushing towards 400 wpm while maintaining comprehension.
- Day 84: Reassess reading speed and comprehension, celebrate progress, and adjust future practice as needed.

Throughout this plan:
- Use text-to-speech software when fatigue sets in or for particularly challenging texts.
- Take regular breaks to prevent eye strain.
- Consistently check comprehension to ensure it's not sacrificed for speed.
- Be patient and adjust the pace if needed, especially considering your dyslexia.

Remember, progress may not be linear, and it's essential to balance speed with comprehension. If you find any technique particularly challenging or unhelpful, we can adjust the plan. Regular practice and patience are key to improving your reading speed and skills.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
