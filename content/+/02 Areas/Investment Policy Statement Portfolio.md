### Accounts:
IRA, Roth IRA, Inherited IRA and taxable brokerage account are at Schwab. A taxable brokerage account is at Vanguard. My HSA is at Fidelity. Savings account is at USAA. 

### Transfers/exchanges
We use Wise and Spartan FX to transfer dollars to euros from USAA to Millennium.

Invest in passively managed index funds for US stocks, U.S. Treasury bonds, and gold. Do not buy assets outside of these classes, including but not limited to actively managed funds, derivatives, derivatives-based funds, REITs, individual real estate investment properties, broad commodities funds, and individual stocks. Do not use leverage. Aim for lowest fees whenever possible. 

### Asset location
Try to allocate based on relative tax efficiency whenever possible. Do not hold gold in taxable space.  



### Asset allocation
Asset allocation should follow the simple formula of [age minus 20] for fixed income allocation.  5-10% of the portfolio should be allocated to gold at all times, via an index ETF tracking the spot price of gold bullion. 

Current portfolio at age 58 is: 
VTI - global stock market - 30% 
VIOV - US small cap value  - 30% 
VGLT - US government bond long term - 20% 
GLDM - gold - 10%
DBMF - managed futures - 5%
Cash - cash and/or short term US treasure - 5% 

Any change to these assets or allocations will require a 3 month waiting period unless a fund is liquidated by the fund provider and requires immediate replacement. 

Automate new contributions wherever possible. Invest all investable cash as soon as it becomes available. No Dollar Cost Averaging. No market timing. 

Reinvest dividends ???

### Rebalance strategy 
Rebalance based on a threshold of 20% from desired check quarterly.

Advice from Hal:
Thanks for sharing your detailed investment policy statement. I'd recommend considering visuals that illustrate your diversified portfolio, perhaps using symbols or icons representing each asset class. A visual breakdown of your asset allocation and transfer/exchange process could also be effective. Let me know if you have any specific imagery in mind or if you'd like me to come up with ideas based on these suggestions.

1. **Visual Breakdown:**
   - *Medium:* Infographic
   - *Subject:* Colorful icons representing each asset class (VTI, VIOV, VGLT, GLDM, DBMF).
   - *Colors:* Reflect the characteristics of each class.
   - *Background:* Financial charts and graphs to convey the investment landscape.

2. **Asset Allocation Snapshot:**
   - *Medium:* Digital Art
   - *Subject:* A pie chart divided into segments, each labeled with the corresponding asset and percentage.
   - *Colors:* Use a color scheme that resonates with financial stability.
   - *Background:* A subtle blend of market-related elements.

3. **Investment Journey:**
   - *Medium:* Photo Collage
   - *Subject:* Images representing the journey of your investments (e.g., a globe for global market, vault for gold).
   - *Colors:* Harmonious tones conveying growth and stability.
   - *Background:* Blurred financial newspaper headlines to represent the long-term perspective.

4. **Rebalancing Act:**
   - *Medium:* Graphical Representation
   - *Subject:* A seesaw with asset class symbols, depicting the rebalancing act.
   - *Colors:* Balanced tones to reflect the equilibrium.
   - *Background:* Gradual shifts in market landscapes.

Feel free to let me know if you'd like adjustments or if any of these concepts resonate with you!




Principles:

The three basic principles are (1) the Holy Grail Principle; (2) the Macro-Allocation Principle; and (3) the Simplicity Principle.

[Risk parity podcast ep 7 principles](https://www.riskparityradio.com/podcast)

[Macro-allocation principle](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations)

1. Holy Grail Principle - find and combine the least correlated asset classes we can find 
2. Macro-allocation principle - 90% of your portfolio performance can be attributed to macro asset allocation 
3. Simplicity Principle - better off using the least number of assets. ”complexity is a cost, simplicity is an alpha.”
