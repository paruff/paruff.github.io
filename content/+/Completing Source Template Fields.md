### Completing Source Template Fields

-   The title of the book becomes the title of the note.
-   The _source type field_ tracks whether the source is a book, video, podcast, or post. I surround these entries with square brackets, making them into links. As a result, when I visit the Book note, I’ll see in its links sections a list of all the Books in my vault.
-   The _author field_ is self-explanatory. The author’s name is linked, which creates an _author note_ for that author.
-   In my system, _domains_ are the dozen or so areas of study that have sustained my interest over time or in which I have cultivated special expertise. (Examples include divination, fiction writing, and, here, adaptive strategy.) This entry is also linked, so I can track how many times a domain is referenced by various notes and quickly discover other sources and notes related to this area of study.
-   The _link_ is an Amazon affiliate link. Clicking the link gives me access to all of Amazon’s info on a book. Copying it gives me a handy affiliate link to share when recommending the book.
-   _Status_ is defined by one of several tags. For books, I use either ToRead for books I haven’t yet read. (When I’m looking for something new to read, a quick search on this tag provides me with a list of options.) Upon completing the book, I change this tag to Completed.
-   The _recommendation field_ reminds me who to thank (for the good reads) and who to annoy with prank phone calls (for the bad ones). When a name appears here, it’s linked to the note associated with that person.
-   The _motive field_ provides a place to record why I pursued or how I encountered a source. My motive statement will likely be peppered with links to various domains, other books, etc.
-   The _rediscovery field_ provides a place to anticipate a situation in which I’d like to rediscover this book. This statement will also incorporate links to domains, other books, events, or even specific dates. (As an aside, I’d like to note that adding the motive and rediscovery fields to my note-making templates has greatly improved the integration and contextualization of my notes over time. If you want to experiment with just one element of my practice in your own, give this one a try.)
-   The date created field is automatically populated each time the source note template is invoked, thanks to a date code embedded in the template.
