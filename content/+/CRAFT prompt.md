**INITIATE WITH PRIMING:**

I am going to provide you with information that I want you to ingest. Once you have ingested this information, I am going to ask you to provide me with content based on the information provided.

Please confirm that you understand by responding, “read.” Please do not self-reference or repeat the information.

**CONTEXT**:

I am the owner of a new consumer packaged good called Solo Mount. Solo Mount is a massage gun mount. Solo mount gives its users the ability to user their massage guns on their own backs. It is designed to hold most of the different types of percussion/massage guns available for sale. Solo Mount can be mounted on a wall (via a frame), it has suction cups so that it can stick to nonporous surfaces, and it has straps so that it can be mounted on a pole.

Users attach solo mount to a wall, refrigerator, pole, etc. The user then puts their massage gun into the mount. Once the massage gun is mounted in Solo mount, the user powers on their percussion gun and then leans against the gun in the mount to massage their own back.
