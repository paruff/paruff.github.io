###  Fact check list pattern:
- Generate a set of facts that are contained in the output
- The set of facts should be inserted at POSITION in the output
- The set of facts should be the fundamental facts that could undermine the veracity of the output if any of them are incorrect
Example:
- Whenever you output text, generate a set of facts that are contained in the output. The set of facts should be inserted at the end of the output. The set of facts should be the fundamental facts that could undermine the veracity of the output if any of them are incorrect.
