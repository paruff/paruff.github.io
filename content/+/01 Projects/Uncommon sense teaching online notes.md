## Video 1: Introduction to Teaching Online

**Key Concepts**

- Research has shown that students can learn even better online than they can in the traditional face-to-face classroom. Teaching online does NOT have to mean reduced effectiveness.
    
- Online teaching that emphasizes active practice while tightening up lecture content appears to be highly efficient.

**Students can learn as well or even better online**

- See pages 6-7 of Joyner, D and Isbell, C. [_The Distributed Classroom_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/distributed): MIT Press, 2021 for a contextualized discussion, citing the research literature, of how students learn better online. We quote here:
    

“To illustrate the range of possible differences [between online and traditional education], we take the example of an online undergraduate class we launched in January 2017 at Georgia Tech. In developing this class, we paid close attention to the research showing that learning outcomes often tend to lag in online compared to traditional classes. We wanted to ensure that the online class—CS1301: Introduction to Computing—could promise comparable learning gains to the traditional version of the same curriculum before rolling it out to a larger audience. The class we produced ended up turning out students who learned as much as or more than students in a traditional version of the class.8 Other experiments at MIT and Carnegie Mellon have found similar results.9 The class has been offered every semester (fifteen terms total) since, totaling over three thousand course completers for credit, and has also been launched as a MOOC; over ten thousand students have completed a MOOC version of the course. This scale was possible only because of the favorable learning gains we observed in our experiments over the first couple of years of delivering the course: without evidence of the learning outcomes, we would have been reluctant to expand the course so heavily.

“These results run counter to an influential thread of research about online education, where the finding has been that outcomes suffer in online environments compared to traditional environments. In response to this result, some have argued that students in selective and prestigious research institutions like MIT, Georgia Tech, and Carnegie Mellon are themselves better prepared to succeed in online classes; they possess the discipline and self-regulation skills necessary to monitor their own progress with limited external structures ensuring their continued engagement.10 Much of the research finding poorer outcomes in online classes comes from community colleges and MOOC providers, and so some argue that the achievement difference is due to differences in the students. Online classes, then, could contribute to a widening of the achievement gap as they allow already well-educated students to move forward even faster based on their ability to succeed in more flexibly-available online courses.

“Others—ourselves included—pose a different explanation. These large research institutions have and are devoting significant resources to developing online initiatives. When David developed our online Introduction to Computing class, we spent a full year writing the textbook, filming the lectures, and developing the initial assessments. We had a team of nearly a dozen people supporting David, including video producers, textbook copyeditors, project managers, technologists, and teaching assistants; in many ways, we had far more support than even traditional face-to-face classes have, before we even consider David’s own prior experience teaching online. Our online master’s-level courses are similarly developed by teams of professors, teaching assistants, instructional technologists, and project managers using world-class facilities. It is perhaps unsurprising that such a large investment of resources creates an educational experience leading to superior learning outcomes.”

## Video 2: Be Wary of Checkbox Advice in Creating Online Courses—The Expertise Reversal Effect and Schemas

**Key Concepts**

- The expertise reversal effect is observed when certain teaching methods can impede the learning of already-skilled learners. 
    
- Learning involves making connections between neurons in long-term memory.
    
- A set of connected neurons involving our knowledge on a topic or in a subject area form what’s called a “schema.” 
    
- Wading through a lot of material just to make a tiny adjustment in a schema is something that students (as well as we teachers) prefer to avoid.

## Video 3: Low-stakes Onboarding Quizzes and Avoiding the Horrors of Goodhart’s Law

**Key Concepts**

- A low stakes on-boarding quiz is a great way to help students learn the most important aspects of your course and your teaching style.
    
- If you are teaching a “flipped” class, you may wish to reduce the average scores for the online quizzes to the average scores for the in-person quizzes, since it can be easier to control for cheating in a traditional, in-person classroom setting.
    
- Goodhart’s Law states that “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” This law reminds us that it can be all-too-easy to fall into a “checkbox” approach that seems to satisfy all the requirements, but in reality, produces a poor online learning experience for students.

## Video 5: Schemas of Identity Can Provide Motivation—or Demotivation

**Key Concepts**

- To get students to engage with one another, you must first get them to engage with you.
    
- Taken together, all of our schemas help provide an overarching sense involving who we are—our identity. Our identity provides fundamental motivations for our actions.
    
- Our job as teachers is to help students develop as well as change their schemas.

# **Key Concepts, References, and Readings**

### **NOTE: All these references and readings are optional**

- Chapter 6 of [_**Uncommon Sense Teaching**_](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/uncommon-sense-teaching/) is especially helpful in providing helpful information related to procedural system, habit-based learning.
    

## Video 1: On (and Off) Camera Habits and the Declarative-Procedural Learning Systems: Why Knowing and Doing are Not the Same Thing

**Key Concepts**

- Two main pathways are used to deposit or tweak links in our neural schemas: The declarative and the procedural pathways.
    
- The declarative pathway takes our conscious thoughts from the front of the brain through the hippocampus into long-term memory.
    
- The procedural pathway of learning flows through the basal ganglia. We are not conscious of what we are doing when we are using the procedural sets of links. Still, these types of links underpin our ability to do highly sophisticated activities, like solve a Rubik’s Cube or speak our native language.
    
- Procedurally-laid links underpin our habits. They can be hard to change.
    

**References**

- For general overview of the declarative (Chapter 3) and procedural (Chapter 6) systems and how they relate to long-term memory, see Oakley, B, Rogowski, B, Sejnowski, T, [_Uncommon Sense Teaching_](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/uncommon-sense-teaching/): Penguin Random House, 2021, and the references therein.

## Video 2: Lights, Camera, Action—Oops!

**Key Concepts**

- Your microphone and ambient environment, camera, camera positioning, and lights have an important effect on your ability to teach well online.  The equipment you choose to use is probably the place where the smallest decisions can have the biggest impact.

## Video 3: "You're Ready for your Close-Up... Wait, Too Close!"

**Key Concepts**

- Your audio quality is much more important than your video quality when you are teaching online.
    
- Your visual background can either be simple or can provide hints for your students about your likes and interests.
    
- Just before going on camera, recheck your:
    
    - Lighting
        
    - Camera framing (common errors are the Frankenstein and gopher effects, or having the head too close to the camera)
        
    - Sound (eliminate the noise of fans if possible)

## Video 4: Breaking Bad Habits When It Comes to Teaching Online—and in Everyday Life

**Key Concepts**

- The best way to change a bad habit—like how you position yourself on camera—is to bring the change you want to conscious awareness, for example, using reminder post-it notes. 
    
- Retrieval practice (“recall”) and spaced repetition help to lay new declarative sets of links and, over time, turn those declarative links into procedural links.

## Video 5: Talk to the Hand—the Power of Gesture to Help Form Mental Models

**Key Concepts**

- Mental models are the thoughts we are holding in working memory. We develop mental models related to concepts, ideas or events we are trying to follow or understand. 
    
- Our gestures and movements can help us develop mental models because they activate a rich network of neurons—our schemas—of remembered experiences that allows us to think more deeply about the ideas we are considering.
    
- When people watch another person move or gesture, their neural networks and schemas are subtly activated to mirror the person they are watching. This is called the “mirror rule.” These mirrored activations help with both mimicking and the development of a mental model.
    
- Whenever you have a success, your brain learns from it and programs that learning into your neural networks to help you repeat that success. This has been termed the “success rule.”

## Video 6: Diving Deeper into Mental Models

**Key Concepts**

- Mental models are like a flock of neural birds continually rearranging themselves in the air as you attempt to grasp a concept or understand a situation.
    
- If you develop a mental model that is important enough to you, and you gain enough experience with it, your mental model can gradually be integrated into your neural schemas.

This especially-intriguing paper found that the hippocampus seems to perform “a general computation—the creation of task-specific low-dimensional manifolds that contain a geometric representation of learned knowledge.”  In other words, the hippocampus can be thought of as where the neural “flock” flies around as it is attempting to grasp an event model.

The nomenclature of what we call “event models” can vary substantially, depending on what theories are being followed and what varying factors are involved. As Sekeres et all note with respect to the concept of episodic memory: “Episodic memories are multifaceted and malleable, capable of being transformed with time and experience at both the neural level and psychological level. At the neural level, episodic memories are transformed from being dependent on the hippocampus to becoming represented in neocortical structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and back again, while at the psychological level, detailed, perceptually rich memories, are transformed to ones retaining only the gist of an experience or a schema related to it. Trace Transformation Theory (TTT) initially proposed that neural and psychological transformations are linked and proceed in tandem… At the heart of the updated TTT lies the long axis of the hippocampus whose functional differentiation and connectivity to neocortex make it a hub for memory formation and transformation. The posterior hippocampus, connected to perceptual and spatial representational systems in posterior neocortex, supports fine, perceptually rich, local details of memories; the anterior hippocampus, connected to conceptual systems in anterior neocortex, supports coarse, global representations that constitute the gist of a memory. Notable among the anterior neocortical structures is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) which supports representation of schemas that code for common aspects of memories across different episodes. Linking the aHPC with mPFC is the entorhinal cortex (EC) which conveys information needed for the interaction/translation between gist and schemas. Thus, the long axis of the hippocampus, mPFC and EC provide the representational gradient, from fine to coarse and from perceptual to conceptual, that can implement processes implicated in memory transformation. Each of these representations of an episodic memory can co-exist and be in dynamic flux as they interact with one another throughout the memory’s lifetime, going from detailed to schematic and possibly back again, all mediated by corresponding changes in neural representation.”

## Video 7: Catching Continuity Errors at the Movies—How Mental Models Arise

**Key Concepts**

- Mental models involve what is being seen, heard, or otherwise experienced. But they also make predictions even as they draw on memories (schemas) of previous experiences.
    
- Virtually everything we do as teachers is done to help students build mental models and schemas in STUDENT’S brains that are similar to the mental models and schemas in OUR brains.

## Video 8: Predicting Effective Online Strategies—Insight from Mental Models & More

**Key Concepts**

- In general, it can be helpful to ask students to make predictions in order to activate prior knowledge within their schemas and help them to begin the process of making a mental model.
    

- Theoretical techniques that can work well in traditional classrooms don’t necessarily transfer to the online world.

## Video 9: How Long Should Online Videos Be? More Insight from Mental Models

**Key Concepts:**

- Although shorter videos are in general better, the maximum length of good online videos is thought to be in the range of 12-20 minutes, not 6 minutes.
    
- Inserting indicators that help frame key concepts can improve memory for that key concept.

If you’re interested in more detail about what an event might actually consist of, in this paper, Franklin and his colleagues, including the Zelig-like Dr. Zacks, note: “Humans spontaneously organize a continuous experience into discrete events and use the learned structure of these events to generalize and organize memory. We introduce the Structured Event Memory (SEM) model of event cognition, which accounts for human abilities in event segmentation, memory, and generalization. SEM is derived from a probabilistic generative model of event dynamics defined over structured symbolic scenes. By embedding symbolic scene representations in a vector space and parametrizing the scene dynamics in this continuous space, SEM combines the advantages of structured and neural network approaches to high-level cognition. Using probabilistic reasoning over this generative model, SEM can infer event boundaries, learn event schemata, and use event knowledge to reconstruct past experience. We show that SEM can scale up to high dimensional input spaces, producing human-like event segmentation for naturalistic video data, and accounts for a wide array of memory phenomena.”

# Week 3, Lesson 1: Retrieval Practice, Mental Models, and Schemas

## **Video 1: Today’s Online Learners Typically Have No Time to Waste**

**Key Concepts**

- Today’s online students often expect and benefit from tightly planned teaching that focuses on quickly conveying the key ideas.
    
- We can help our students by teaching them about the value of retrieval practice and expecting them to use retrieval practice in their private study sessions between classes.
    
- Retrieval practice is good, not just for relatively simple facts, but to help students gain a deeper conceptual understanding of the materials.

## **Video 2: What on Earth Do Retrieval Practice and Spaced Repetition Have to Do with Mental Models? Or Good Online Teaching?**

**Key Concepts**

- Retrieval practice with spaced repetition creates and recreates mental models that help strengthen neural connections in schemas in long-term memory.
    
- An **EVENT** is what is happening OUTSIDE the student. The **MENTAL MODEL** is what students construct IN their brain to model—in some sense, understand—the external event with their conscious working memory.
    
- Online teaching can give us a great platform to encapsulate key concepts by turning them into tightly scripted events that are easier to retrieve.

## **Video 3: “If I told you, I’d have to…” Skirting Around the Complexity of Working Memory and Mental Models**

**Key Concepts**

- The mental model being held in working memory is extremely complex, even for the seeming simplest of events. It can be difficult even for experienced neuroscientists to explain to non-neuroscientists. But thinking in terms of metaphors—the mental model is a flock of birds, while working memory is an octopus, can help.

## **Video 4: Driving Home the Idea that Retrieval Practice Helps Solidify Both Simple and Complex Events in Schemas**

**Key Concepts**

- Even seemingly simple ideas, like a vocabulary word in a foreign language, can involve extraordinary complexities. “Simple” retrieval practice isn’t necessarily so simple!
    
- Retrieval practice is useful even for complicated topics—as long as the topics are “graspable” by working memory.

## **Video 5: Cognitive Load—If the Event is Too Complicated, Watch Out!**

**Key Concepts**

- If an event is too complex, it becomes difficult for working memory to grasp. It is better to break the ideas into smaller “flocks” of thoughts or concepts. This is called “scaffolding” or “chunking.”
    
- Declarative information passes through the hippocampus. Procedural information passes through the basal ganglia. The basic process of retrieval practice helps with both declarative and procedural learning.
    
- Once information is in long-term memory, it can meld together—consolidate—into larger, cohesive chunks of information that are easy to draw into mind even though they involve complicated ideas.

## Video 9: Working Memory, Non-Native Speakers, and Barb’s Personal Experience with Retrieval Practice

**Key Concepts**

- A typical working memory can hold roughly four pieces of information in mind. But the size of a piece of information depends on the learner’s background expertise in the area—their underlying schema.
    
- Be aware that non-native speakers also have the added cognitive load of trying to grasp the information being taught via what is to them a foreign language. Reduce the processing burden of foreign language speakers by enunciating clearly and avoiding slang. (We realize, however, that a little slang can sometimes make such a big difference on native speakers of English that it’s worth the tradeoff.)
    
- Retrieval practice is particularly valuable for students with a lesser working memory capacity—it can allow them to excel even in difficult subject areas.

# **Week 4, Lesson 1: Focus, Suspense, and Creativity**

## **Key Concepts, References, and Readings**

## Video 1: “Focused” versus “Diffuse” Thinking—Setting the Stage for Their Relevance to Online Teaching

**Key Concepts**

- The brain has two different ways of functioning—in “focused” or in “diffuse” modes. Focused mode has our tight attention. Diffuse mode is more relaxed, and is associated with mind-wandering, day-dreaming, and creativity.
    
- Your online teaching can make intelligent use of these two different modes to help students be more engaged and creative.

Contrasting conceptual and embodied mechanisms of learning](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-00099-001).” _Journal of Educational Psychology_, (2021). This paper provides background in conceptual salience theory: “Building on working memory theory, conceptual salience theory assumes that students have to explicitly attend to information in order to load it into working memory (Mayer, 2009; Miller, 1956). Representations can be designed so that they attract students’ attention (Mayer & Moreno, 1998; Schnotz, 2005)…. Conceptual salience theory explains the concept-dependency of findings from earlier studies by proposing that the mode that makes a concept more salient yields higher learning gains for that concept (Olympiou & Zacharia, 2012).”
    

## Video 2: Attention—How to Get It, and Why You Want to Sometimes Lose It

**Key Concepts**

- Students pay attention because of either top-down conscious will power, or bottom-up automatic attention because of sensory input like a sound or movement. Online learning allows for particularly creative approaches to attracting attention by using bottom-up approaches.
    
- Breakout and active sessions where students interact with one another during synchronous online sessions can allow for momentary “diffuse mode” breaks, so they return to focused attention with a fresher perspective.
    
- A benefit of asynchronous teaching—that is, watching a video—is that if a student might catch themselves mind-wandering, they can stop the video and go back to where they left off.

## 4C-4: It’s Good to Leave Them Hanging! The Value of Suspense

**Key Concepts**

- Suspense and “hooks” in teaching can help suppress the diffuse mode and prevent mind-wandering. This can naturally help students to keep their focus on what is being learned.

## 4C-5: Humor Does NOT Mean Being a Comedian

**Key Concepts**

- Even a few seconds of diffuse mode relaxing break during class can help students return to focus refreshed—as for example, when students might momentarily turn to work together, or you tell a joke.
    
- Sporadic use of humor is especially helpful in keeping students engaged in online teaching.

## 4C-6: Creating a Social Partnership

**Key Concepts**

- Seeing an instructor looking, smiling, and speaking “as if” a conversational partner was there can create the illusion of social partnership.
    
- When you are enthusiastic and passionate, the mirroring effect means your students mirror your behavior.
    
- Mirroring of your expressive, passionate enthusiasm can help even unmotivated students to become more motivated.

## 4C-7: Teleprompters and Giant Frogs

**Key Concepts**

- Many instructors can benefit from scripted material read from a teleprompter.  If you use a teleprompter:
    
    - Look away from the camera occasionally, as you would in a natural conversation.
        
    - Be sure to look toward what you might be pointing to. (You can do this even if you are “picture-in-picture.”)
        
- If you don’t script your material, you can still benefit from using a list of bullet points to talk from on your teleprompter.

## 4C-8: The Paradox of Self-Focus

**Key Concepts**

- “Micro-choking” episodes occur when declarative, conscious thoughts about yourself and how you are feeling and looking intrude on your teaching.
    
- By moving your thoughts away from yourself and focusing externally on your camera (that is, your students), you activate the automatic procedural system. You can then find yourself teaching smoothly and naturally, without self-consciousness.
    
- Eyebrow flashes, head tilts, and full, natural smiles that also bring wrinkles to the eyes can signal your students that you are friendly and approachable. What student, after all, wants to take a course from an unlikeable instructor?
    
- Make sure you are not too close to the camera, so that your stimulating gaze doesn’t become overstimulating.

### Week 4 part 2

# **Key Concepts, References, and Readings**

## Video 9: Mental Model and Schema Sharing

**Key Concepts**

- Students and teachers have differing underlying schemas—neural frameworks of expertise—in their long-term memories.
    
- Teachers’ schemas about their subject are rich and complex. Students’ schemas on the topic of study are naturally very sparse—although students can still follow and grasp, sometimes through the use of metaphor, their teachers’ thoughts (their “mental models”).
    
- As students develop their mental models about what is being taught, their thoughts are like flocks of birds that circle and swoop. Students can help guide one another’s neural “flocks” of thoughts when the teacher is inadvertently drawing on schemas that the students do not yet have.

## Video 10: Jolts of Joy

**Key Concepts**

- Feeling that another, familiar person is interacting with us activates mirroring and other circuits that make us feel rewarded. This can allow us to find pleasure in learning with others.
    
- We need to use caution and balance in our teaching—when collective approaches are emphasized, people can come to desire acceptance by the group over acknowledging truth and empirical evidence. And the larger the collaborative team, the more creativity is reduced.
    
- The “synchronicity paradox” relates to the idea that many students crave rich synchronous experience at the same time that they crave the flexibility of asynchronous online learning.
    
- Eye gaze can provide for powerful feelings of connection.  But for some neurodiverse students, these feelings can become overpowering.

## Video 11: The Challenge of Discussion Forums

**Key Concepts**

- Making discussions mandatory or trying to have novice students give answers and feedback on one another’s questions are not good uses of this environment.
    
- To get students started using a discussion forum in smaller classes, encourage students to post their questions, and give bonus points for providing helpful hints in answer.

## Video 12: Wrap Up: Learning as Therapy—and As Preparation for the Future!

**Key Concepts**

- New learning helps new neurons survive and thrive—which helps improve learners’ moods. 
    
- Online teaching provides a vitally important form of human infrastructure. Your role in building and maintaining this infrastructure can make a tremendous difference for your students, and for society as a whole.
    
- Our hope is that the mental models—the key concepts—we’ve been describing in this course have been transferred and transformed within you as they’ve gradually made their way into your schemas of long-term memory.

As the authors note “Neural engagement as defined by ‘the extent to which an observer's brain becomes engrossed in a stimulus.’” “…high displays of passion recruits the brain in a way that increases fixation on the stimulus, which is the pitch. And because higher neural engagement increases focus and attention to the content and overrides distractions, we theorize that more engaged brains are more likely to meaningfully evaluate pitches, which should result in more favorable investor assessments. We argue that neural engagement partially mediates the displayed passion-investor interest relationship: Displays of passion trigger heightened engagement that, in turn, makes investors more likely to invest.”  As it is with investors is as it can be with inducing students to passionately decide to engage and invest in learning!
