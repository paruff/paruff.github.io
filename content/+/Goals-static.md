# Goals

I have a few goals:

[[Meditation]] , well I guess that is a practice to support mindfulness , which is in support of emotional health and [[enlightenment]]

[[01 Projects/Learn Portuguese/Portuguese]] language at least to A2 level as that is required for citizenship in portugal. That is clearly an external goal.

A [[01 Projects/Edible Forest/food forest/Food forest MOC]], or is it grow our owne food. It also includes creating an habitat for the local wildlife. Seems it is complicated.Steward of 

Generative life, shifting from my consumptive style of life to a generative approach to living.
