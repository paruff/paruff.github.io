A healthy ideaverse will have notes that you'll want to do something to, but it may not be specific or too urgent. Here are my favorite time-tested examples.

> [!Multi-column] 
> > [!connect]+ #### Notes to refactor across the ideaverse
> > All notes with `#note/refactorðŸª“`. Limit `10`
> > 
> > ``` dataview
> > TABLE WITHOUT ID
> >  file.link as "Notes",
> >  (date(today) - file.mday).day as "Days since last evolved"
> > 
> > FROM #note/refactorðŸª“ 
> > 
> > SORT file.name asc
> > 
> > LIMIT 10
> > 
> > ```
> 
> > [!blocks]+ #### Notes to tidy across the ideaverse
> > All notes with `#note/tidyðŸ§¹`. Limit `10`
> > 
> > ``` dataview
> > TABLE WITHOUT ID
> >  file.link as "Notes",
> >  (date(today) - file.mday).day as "Days since last evolved"
> > 
> > FROM #note/tidyðŸ§¹ 
> > 
> > SORT file.name asc
> > 
> > LIMIT 10
> > 
> > ```

> [!Multi-column] 
> > [!recycle]+ #### Notes to revisit across the ideaverse
> > All notes with `#note/revisitðŸ”Ž`. Limit `10`
> > 
> > ``` dataview
> > TABLE WITHOUT ID
> >  file.link as "Notes",
> >  (date(today) - file.mday).day as "Days since last evolved"
> > 
> > FROM #note/revisitðŸ”Ž 
> > 
> > SORT file.name asc
> > 
> > LIMIT 10
> > 
> > ```
> 
> > [!calendar]+ #### Dusty notes across the ideaverse
> > The oldest unchanged notes. Limit `10`
> > ``` dataview
> > TABLE WITHOUT ID
> >  file.link as "Notes",
> >  (date(today) - file.mday).day as "Days since last encounter"
> > 
> > FROM "Atlas"
> > 
> > SORT file.mtime asc
> > 
> > LIMIT 10
> > ```
