#### Introduction
Olive trees are a quintessential part of Mediterranean landscapes and a valuable addition to your permaculture food forest. They are known for their longevity, resilience, and the delicious olives they produce. This guide will help you grow, water, harvest, preserve, and maintain your olive trees effectively.

#### Growing Olive Trees

1. **Choosing the Right Variety**
   - **Arbequina**: Small, hardy tree that produces small, flavorful olives. Suitable for warm climates.
   - **Koroneiki**: High-yielding tree that produces small olives with a high oil content.
   - **Mission**: Large, slow-growing tree that produces large, meaty olives.

2. **Planting**
   - **Location**: Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil. Olive trees need at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily¹.
   - **Soil**: Prefer well-drained soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5¹.
   - **Planting Time**: Plant in early spring or fall when temperatures are mild².
   - **Spacing**: Space trees about 20 feet apart to allow for growth and air circulation².

#### Watering Olive Trees

- **Young Trees**: Water deeply once a week during the first two years to establish strong roots³.
- **Mature Trees**: Olive trees are drought-tolerant but benefit from deep watering every two weeks during dry periods³.
- **Avoid Overwatering**: Ensure the soil is well-drained to prevent root rot³.

#### Harvesting Olives

- **Timing**: Olives are usually ready for harvest in late fall to early winter⁴.
- **Indicators**: Ripe olives change color from green to black or purple, depending on the variety⁴.
- **Method**: Hand-pick or use a small rake to gently remove olives from the branches⁴.

#### Preserving Olives

1. **Curing**: Olives must be cured before they are edible. Methods include brine curing, dry curing, and lye curing.
2. **Brine Curing**: Soak olives in a saltwater solution for several weeks, changing the brine periodically.
3. **Dry Curing**: Pack olives in salt for several weeks, then rinse and store in olive oil.
4. **Lye Curing**: Use a lye solution to cure olives quickly, then rinse thoroughly and soak in brine.

#### Maintaining Olive Trees

1. **Pruning**
   - **Timing**: Prune in late winter or early spring before new growth begins³.
   - **Method**: Remove dead or diseased branches, thin out crowded areas, and shape the tree to improve airflow and sunlight penetration³.

2. **Fertilizing**
   - **Type**: Use a balanced fertilizer or compost to provide essential nutrients³.
   - **Frequency**: Fertilize in early spring and again in late summer³.

3. **Pest and Disease Management**
   - **Common Pests**: Olive fruit fly, scale insects, and aphids³.
   - **Diseases**: Verticillium wilt, olive knot, and peacock spot³.
   - **Prevention**: Regularly inspect trees, use organic sprays if necessary, and maintain good garden hygiene³.
