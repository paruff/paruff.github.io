1.  [[03 Resources/Permaculture Design Course/Introduction to Permaculture]]– This section and the next lay the foundation with the [[01 Projects/Edible Forest/core permaculture principles]] on which permaculture is based.
2.  **Concepts and Themes in Design –** You might call this portion _How Does an Ecosystem Work?_
3.  **Methods of Design –** Now we start getting into the nitty-gritty tools and techniques for replicating natural, self-sustaining ecosystems!
4.  **Pattern Understanding –** Circles, spirals, waves, branches…we see certain patterns over and over again in nature and human designs, but why? What purposes do they serve, and which should be used in X situation?
5.  [[01 Projects/Edible Forest/Climatic Factors]] – These days, when we hear about climate, the first word that probably comes to mind is “change” – but here we’ll be looking at more basic questions.
6.  **Trees and Their Energy Transactions –** You probably know about the roles that trees play as fuel, raw material, and carbon storage, but are you aware of the many other functions they serve in living forests?
7.  **Water –** While Earth is called “the watery planet,” humans have tended to mismanage our fresh [[Water]] supply, threatening the availability of our most precious resource. Here you’ll learn about how humans have intervened in regional water systems, and how we can repair them.
8.  **Soils –** Yes, that’s right – soils in the plural! We have so much to say here – where most people see soil as _dirt,_ permaculturists see it as a living ecosystem in itself.
9.  **Livestock and Aquaculture –** An ecosystem relies on animal integration to benefit itself and us as humans.
10.  **Earthworking and Earth Resources –** One common remedy for runoff and erosion is earthworking: building berms and digging swales.
11.  **Strategies of an Alternative Global Nation –** Long before we reach the end of the course, you’ll realize that permaculture offers a whole new guiding vision for human society…and agriculture is just one tiny facet of this vision.
