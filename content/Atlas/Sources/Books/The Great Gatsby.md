listening to it because it turns up on many greatest books lists and have never engaged it and it is much shorter then many on the list. I might listen to a few of the American books Huckleberry Finn and Moby Dick as they are shorter and it is summer so I am not likely to spend to much time listening or read over the next month or two.

More once I have heard more of it.
