- Insectaries: attract predatory and parasitoid insects with nectar, pollen, and shelter.
- Repellents: deter pests through olfactory or visual confusion.
- Trap Crops: attract pests away from crop.
- Nitrogen fixers: add nitrogen to the soil and won’t compete for this nutrient.
- Light feeders: have low nitrogen requirements and won’t compete for this nutrient.
- Ground covers: act as cover crops for water retention, soil protection, and to hinder weeds.
- Shade providers: offer protection in the form of shade from hot sun and while plants are getting established.
- Support providers: offer a structure for other plants to climb on.
- Non-allelopathic species: do not contain compounds harmful to neighboring species.
