# Welcome to CraftsPrinted4u!

CraftsPrinted4u is an Etsy store that offers high-quality, personalized, and affordable t-shirts for any occasion. Whether you're looking for a gift for a teacher, a nurse, a cat lover, or yourself, you'll find something that suits your taste and budget at CraftsPrinted4u.

## Our Story

CraftsPrinted4u was born out of a desire to add value to others and share our joy of crafting. We are Phil and Maria, a retired couple who live and work in Gaeiras, Portugal. We have always been interested in knitting, gardening, and permaculture, and we wanted to turn our hobbies into a business, and share our creations with the world.

We opened our Etsy shop in 2023, and since then we have been learning and improving our skills and products. We are currently focused on t-shirts, but we plan to expand our catalog once our customers have told us which of our designs they like the most. We love to hear from our customers and their suggestions.

## Our Products

At CraftsPrinted4u, we offer a wide range of t-shirts, from funny, inspirational, and motivational, to cute, artistic, and trendy. You can choose from our ready-made designs, or request a custom order and we'll create something unique for you.

All our t-shirts are made with high-quality materials and printed with eco-friendly ink. We use the latest technology and equipment to ensure that our t-shirts are durable, vibrant, and accurate. We also pack and ship our t-shirts with care, so that they arrive safely and quickly to your doorstep.

## Our Values

We believe that printing is not just a process, but an art form. We are passionate about what we do, and we strive to deliver the best products and service to our customers. We value quality, creativity, and customer satisfaction above all else.

We also care about the environment and our community. That's why we use recycled and biodegradable materials whenever possible, and we donate a portion of our profits to local charities and causes.

## Our Team

CraftsPrinted4u is a small but mighty team of two: Phil and Maria. We are a married couple who enjoy working together and sharing our skills and ideas. We also love to spend time in our permaculture orchard, preparing plant-based meals, practicing yoga and meditation, and cuddling with our cats.

We have always had a passion for teachers and nurses, as our family is full of them, and they have always supported us when in need. We want to share our gratitude and appreciation with them, and offer them t-shirts that can inspire, motivate, and comfort them.

We also love to print!
