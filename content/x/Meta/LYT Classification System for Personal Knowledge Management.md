 While I encourage you to fully customize your **home** note, I urge you to start building your library note using the **LYT Classification System**.  

The **LYT Classification System** is lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.

| 900     | History & Biography & Geography                   |

Please don't go crazy numbering things. We are just using a pre-made map so we can easily relate new dots of interests to known bits of knowledge.
