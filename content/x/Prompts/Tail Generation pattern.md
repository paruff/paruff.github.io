###  Tail Generation pattern:
 - At the end, repeat Y and/or ask me for X.
Example:
-  Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next. Ask me for what to outline
