### Comprehensive Guild for Peach Trees

#### Introduction
Creating a permaculture guild for your peach trees in a Mediterranean climate will enhance their health and productivity while fostering a sustainable ecosystem. This guild will include companion plants that support the peach trees by improving soil health, attracting beneficial insects, and repelling pests.

#### Key Components of the Guild

1. **Nitrogen Fixers**
   - **Lupines**: These beautiful flowers fix nitrogen in the soil and attract pollinators.
   - **Clover**: A low-growing ground cover that enriches the soil with nitrogen.
   - **Pigeon Pea**: A shrub that provides nitrogen and can be used as a chop-and-drop mulch.

2. **Dynamic Accumulators**
   - **Comfrey**: Deep roots mine nutrients from the soil, making them available to other plants. It also provides excellent mulch.
   - **Yarrow**: Attracts beneficial insects and improves soil health.

3. **Pollinator Attractors**
   - **Lavender**: Attracts bees and other pollinators while providing a pleasant fragrance.
   - **Marigold**: Attracts beneficial insects and repels pests.

4. **Pest Repellents**
   - **Garlic**: Repels pests and can be planted around the base of the peach tree.
   - **Chives**: Another great pest repellent that also attracts pollinators.

5. **Ground Covers**
   - **Strawberries**: Provide ground cover, reduce soil erosion, and offer delicious fruit.
   - **Sweet Potato**: A vigorous ground cover that also produces edible tubers.

6. **Support Species**
   - **Sunflowers**: Provide shade and attract pollinators. Their deep roots also help break up compacted soil.
   - **Bamboo**: Can be used as a windbreak and provides stakes for other plants.

7. **Mulch Plants**
   - **Pumpkins**: Their large leaves provide excellent ground cover and mulch.
   - **Squash**: Similar to pumpkins, they help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.

#### Planting and Maintenance Tips

- **Spacing**: Ensure adequate spacing between plants to avoid competition for resources.
- **Watering**: Peach trees need regular watering, especially during the hot summer months. Mulching helps retain soil moisture.
- **Pruning**: Regularly prune the peach tree and companion plants to maintain airflow and reduce disease risk.
- **Soil Health**: Regularly add organic matter, such as compost, to improve soil fertility and structure.

#### Conclusion
By implementing this comprehensive guild, you'll create a thriving ecosystem that supports your peach trees and enhances the overall health of your permaculture food forest. This approach not only reduces your environmental impact but also provides healthy food for you, your wife, and your friends.
