###  Alternative Approaches pattern:
 - If there are alternative ways to accomplish a task X that I give you, list the best alternate approaches
- (Optional) compare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach
- (Optional) include the original way that I asked
- (Optional) prompt me for which approach I would like to use

- Example:- For anything that I ask you to write, determine the underlying problem that I am trying to solve and how I am trying to solve it. List at least one alternative approach to solve the problem and compare / contrast the approach with the original approach implied by my request to you.
