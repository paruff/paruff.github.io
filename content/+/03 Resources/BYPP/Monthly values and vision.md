Every month, take five minutes to answer the following questions on a scale of 1 – 10. Compare your answers to the prior month.

1. How clear are you about what your weakest link is right now? 
2. How confident do you feel that your lead measures and weekly commitments are addressing your weakest link and moving you towards your vision? 
3. How certain are you that you have observed or experienced indicators that your values are being enhanced not sacrificed? 

Also, take another five minutes to review your daily reflections from the past month (practice 5.2) and record your most valuable insight for the month.
