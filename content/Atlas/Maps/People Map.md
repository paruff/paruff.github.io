Have a place to honor the importance of the people your life.  Once you feel comfortable, if you add notes for peopleâ€”whether they are living or notâ€”you will notice that it can help your understanding of them.

Here's a cool view for you:

> [!user]+ ## Prominent People ðŸŒ‹
> The hope is to see these prominent people in various ways to pull out insights. For example, by date allowed me to see that both Carl Sagan and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi were born in 1934.

Here are the main things I do related to notes on people:

- Make note of special memories
- Jot down notable information
- Learn entirely new industries
- Learn more about people

> [!NOTE]- Some links and content in this note have been removed.
> Because this is a vertical slice of my actual PKM system, I can't include everything in this vault and I left out some notes and material for ease of navigation and understanding the concepts (rather than getting lost in the knowledge) as well as for privacy. 
>  
> Plus, it's okay to have some unlinked notes in your own vault. They won't all be built out at once.
