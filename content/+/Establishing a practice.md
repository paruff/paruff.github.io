STAGE ONE: ESTABLISHING A PRACTICE
This Stage is about developing a consistent and diligent meditation practice. Being consistent means setting a clear daily schedule for when you’re going to meditate, and sticking to it except when there are circumstances beyond your control. Diligence means engaging wholeheartedly in the practice rather than spending your time on the cushion planning or daydreaming.
Goals: Develop a regular meditation practice.
Obstacles: Resistance, procrastination, fatigue, impatience, boredom, lack of motivation.
Skills: Creating practice routines, setting specific practice goals, generating strong motivation, cultivating discipline and diligence.
Mastery: Never missing a daily practice session.



TABLE 5. THE SEVEN PROBLEMS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES


Problem
Antidote


PROCRASTINATION AND RESISTANCE TO PRACTICING
Frequently recall the benefits of practice, constantly refresh and renew your motivation, and “just do it.” See Stage One.


DISTRACTIONS, FORGETTING, AND MIND-WANDERING
Each part of the problem is addressed sequentially. In Stage Two, work with mind-wandering. In Stage Three, work on overcoming forgetting. In Stages Four through Six, work on overcoming all distractions.


IMPATIENCE
Rather than identifying with impatience, learn to observe it objectively. Cultivate joy, peace, contentment, and equanimity. See Stage Two

MONKEY-MIND
An agitated, overly energized mind is in constant motion and can’t stay focused on anything. The antidote is to get grounded in the body. See Stage Two.


SELF-DOUBT
Do everything you can to keep your motivation strong. Don’t compare yourself to others. Make meditation a habit.


DULLNESS, DROWSINESS, AND SLEEPINESS
Decreased mental energy leads to dullness, then drowsiness and sleep. Counter strong dullness by energizing the mind using techniques described in Stages Three and Four. In Stage Five, work on overcoming subtle dullness.


PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT
Find the most comfortable position possible. See Stage One. Use physical discomfort as part of the practice to develop the Insight that pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. See Stages Three and Four.
