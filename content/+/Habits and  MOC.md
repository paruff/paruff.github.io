 - James Clear,  Atomic Habit
 - Charles Duhigg, The Power of Habit
 - Dan Pink, Drive
 - Cal Newport, Slow Productivity

I like these ideas and when I think of this book I think of Charles Duhigg's book The Power of Habits and the keystone habits. Both are also somehow linked to the author of Drive… Dan Pink which is also link to Cal Newport.
