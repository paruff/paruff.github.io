### Permaculture Guild for Fig Trees

#### Overview
Creating a permaculture guild around fig trees will enhance their growth, support biodiversity, improve soil health, and reduce pests and diseases. The following guild is designed specifically for a Mediterranean climate like Gaeiras, Portugal, and will support a resilient and productive food forest.

#### Core Tree: Fig Tree (Ficus carica)
- **Climate Adaptation:** Thrives in Mediterranean climates.
- **Soil Requirements:** Well-drained, loamy soil with a pH of 6.0-6.5.
- **Water Needs:** Moderate; drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during dry spells.
- **Sunlight:** Full sun.

#### Key Elements of the Guild

1. **Nitrogen Fixers**
   - **Purpose:** Improve soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen.
   - **Plants:**
     - **Clover (Trifolium spp.):** Ground cover, improves nitrogen content.
     - **Lupin (Lupinus spp.):** Deep roots help break up compacted soil and add nitrogen.

2. **Dynamic Accumulators**
   - **Purpose:** Bring up nutrients from deeper soil layers.
   - **Plants:**
     - **Comfrey (Symphytum officinale):** Deep roots, mulch source, attracts pollinators.
     - **Yarrow (Achillea millefolium):** Attracts beneficial insects, improves soil structure.

3. **Ground Covers**
   - **Purpose:** Protect soil, retain moisture, suppress weeds.
   - **Plants:**
     - **Strawberries (Fragaria spp.):** Edible, attract pollinators, ground cover.
     - **Thyme (Thymus spp.):** Aromatic, deters pests, low-growing.

4. **Pollinator Attractors**
   - **Purpose:** Enhance pollination and attract beneficial insects.
   - **Plants:**
     - **Lavender (Lavandula spp.):** Aromatic, attracts bees and butterflies.
     - **Marigold (Tagetes spp.):** Attracts pollinators and beneficial insects, deters pests.

5. **Pest Deterrents**
   - **Purpose:** Protect fig trees from pests naturally.
   - **Plants:**
     - **Garlic (Allium sativum):** Deters aphids, beetles, and other pests.
     - **Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus):** Trap crop for aphids, attracts beneficial insects.

6. **Companion Plants**
   - **Purpose:** Enhance growth, repel pests, and provide additional harvests.
   - **Plants:**
     - **Borage (Borago officinalis):** Attracts pollinators, deters tomato hornworms.
     - **Chives (Allium schoenoprasum):** Deters aphids, improves soil health.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Site Preparation**
   - **Soil Testing:** Conduct a soil test to determine pH and nutrient levels.
   - **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer of mulch around the fig tree to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

2. **Planting**
   - **Spacing:** Ensure appropriate spacing between plants to avoid competition and allow for air circulation.
   - **Planting Order:** Start with larger plants like comfrey and lupin, then add ground covers and smaller plants like garlic and chives.

3. **Maintenance**
   - **Watering:** Regularly water during dry spells, especially during the establishment period.
   - **Mulching:** Reapply mulch annually to maintain soil moisture and fertility.
   - **Pruning:** Prune fig trees in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead or diseased wood.

4. **Observation and Adaptation**
   - **Monitor Plant Health:** Regularly check for signs of pests, diseases, or nutrient deficiencies.
   - **Adjust Guild:** Add or replace plants as necessary to maintain a balanced and healthy ecosystem.

#### Benefits
- **Increased Yield:** Improved pollination and reduced pest pressure.
- **Soil Health:** Enhanced soil fertility and structure through natural processes.
- **Biodiversity:** A diverse range of plants supporting a healthy ecosystem.
- **Sustainability:** Reduced need for synthetic inputs and enhanced resilience to climate variability.

By implementing this fig tree guild, you'll create a thriving, self-sustaining system that supports both your food forest's productivity and the health of the surrounding environment.
