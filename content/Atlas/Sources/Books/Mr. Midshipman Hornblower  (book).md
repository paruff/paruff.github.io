I listened to the is recently exploring the source or inspiration for the Maturin abaury series which I enjoy a decade ago or so. I am also exploring other options as I have time to enjoy stories and listen to these as I fall asleep at night or as I nap during the day. Mostly I donâ€™t even nap I rest and that will often allow me time to recover and then I am off to other activities.
I am also watching the series based on the books.
