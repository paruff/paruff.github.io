*The "x" folder stands for "extras"*. It's an easy way to tuck away those "extra" types of notes, such as:

- Notes about notes: Meta notes, Vault-related notes
- Non-notes: Images, PDFs, and other file types
- Utility notes: Templates
- Archived notes

But it's more than that. *It's a release valve for organizational angst.* I use in constantly for: 

- Less immediately relevant "placeholder folders": While not overly important now, these folders still serve you as a tucked away reminder of a topic or area of simmering or potential interest. This is really important!

The "x" folder works incredibly well anywhere, whether it's in Obsidian or in your computer's file folder system. Use them liberally. Use them at any level. For example, you'll notice an "x" folder within the Atlas folder.

**An example in the Atlas folder:**

If I was an amateur chef with a growing number of recipe notes, I might create a "Recipes" folder and put it in Atlas. If I was building a personal library of important exercises, I could make an "Exercises" folder. (Note: You don't have to make folders like this. That's the beauty of linked notes. But people still like to for their own reasons.) Over time, several folders like these might clutter the Atlas folder. If you ever get that feeling, just tuck them away in the "x" folder. 

Along with being a way to relieve the stress of unneeded and distracting folder management angst, *"x" folders conveniently sort at the bottom of alphabetical lists*, making them a reliable and constant part of any folder structure that might need them.
