I have recently , 2024 , been rewatching this. 

There is a scene in it which is very similar to that i the Lord of the Rings, I think it is Return of the King but may be The Two Towers. When the scarecrow, tin man and the lion with Toto are looking to get into the wicked witches castles is similar in shots to that of when Gollum , Frodo and Sam are considering going into the Mordor . Events are different and it felt very similar.
