#### page 61 - Shift from the partial nature of historians to Liberty and making a distinction between individual liberty and national liberty. And here and above referring to the [[syntopicon]] which I might think of as a linked summary of ideas.
#### 62 - Liberty and the documents the support it and the evolution over time of those documents from 1689 in England to the Declaration of Independence 1776 in the US to UN declaration in 1954
#### 63 - explores the universal declaration of human rights, which passed 40-0 with a few communist abstentions, and notes that no country lives up to the declaration.
-  64 -explores the minority and the majority and attempts to balance the power of each using examples of the US before the civil war and the UN with its single veto on the permanent member security Council
- 65 - explores the individual in opposition to the government and laws, used Henry David Thoreau not paying his taxes as they were used to support the Mexican war and slavery.
