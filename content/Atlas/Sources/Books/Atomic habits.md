-   **Title:** "Atomic habits"
-   **Author:** James Clear
-   **Status:** #ToRead #reading #complete
-   **Date Created:** 13-11-22 | Sunday

I like these ideas and when I think of this book I think of Charles Duhigg's book The Power of Habits and the keystone habits. Both are also somehow linked to the author of Drive… Dan Pink which is also link to Cal Newport. So this has turned into a MOC not sure what it is of and we can sort that out later
