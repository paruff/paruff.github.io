Ken Wilber a very interesting guy. Spirituality and mindfulness. Early introduction to him came from a mass market book titled _[The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Sense_and_Soul:_Integrating_Science_and_Religion "The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion")_, and then I read lots of things. He tends to explain his view of the world for the first 50- 100 pages of most of his later books.

I found his interactions with others commenting on the Ultimate Matrix Collection engrossing and enlightening. Also I would not want to be talking about the same topic as Ken as he seems to fill all the space.

I purchased and engaged with Integral Life Practice kit https://integrallife.com/practice/

When I think of Carl Sagan, I think of [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)]]. What Carl Sagan did for my love of the cosmos, [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)]] did for my love of [[Flow]]. Both have enriched my life.

- That reminds me...
- It's similar because...
- It's different because...
- It's important because...

## Extra
###### Pale Blue Dot: Chapter 3, *The Great Demotions*
Sagan calls the "Great Demotions" moments in scientific history that downgraded humanity's place in the universe. Galileo helped to show that the Earth was not the only "world" along with it not being the center of the universe, bringing about another great demotion. Other great demotions have occurred, however, such as our discovery that we do not live in the only galaxy, or that our galaxy is not at the center of the universe or that no other star has planets. Today we have even discovered planets orbiting other stars.
