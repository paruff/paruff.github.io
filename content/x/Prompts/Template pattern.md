### Template pattern:
 - prompt: - I am going to provide a template for your output
- X is my placeholder for content
- Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list
- Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide
- This is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLDERS
You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate placeholder, such as "CAPITALIZED WORDS" or "<PLACEHOLDER>". You will then need to specify a pattern to fill in, such as "Dear <FULL NAME>" or "NAME, TITLE, COMPANY".
